# JARVIS
My autonomous robot Jarvis. The video uploaded shows my robot walking until an object (in this case, my hand) obstructs the robot. Jarvis then stops, looks both ways and determines which way is safer to travel (more open) and goes in that direction.

Composed of: 
  1. Arduino Uno
  2. Servo Motor
  3. Dual Axle Gearboox
  4. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
